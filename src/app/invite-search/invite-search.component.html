  Compsant invite-search works!

<div id="search-component">
    <h2>Rechercher un invite</h2>
   
    <!-- The search() method is called via an event binding to the textbox's keystroke event. -->
    <input #searchBox id="search-box" (keyup)="search(searchBox.value)" />
   
    <ul class="search-result">
      <li *ngFor="let invite of invites$ | async" >
          <!-- The $ is a convention that indicates heroes$ is an Observable, not an array.
          The *ngFor can't do anything with an Observable. But there's also a pipe character (|) followed by async, which identifies Angular's AsyncPipe.
          The AsyncPipe subscribes to an Observable automatically so you won't have to do so in the component class. -->
